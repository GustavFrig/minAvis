            <h2>What's improved on the new switch?</h2>
            <p>The Switch 2 is supposed to be a pure upgrade from the original console that was released on the 3. of march, 2017.
                The Switch 2 is said to be larger than the original, up to 8 inches from the original 7, and there are rumors that it will be more powerful than the original, which may allow for gaming on 60fps.</p>
                The new console also has a new fastening mechanism, with the controllers connecting to the console by magnets.
                The buttons on the controllers have gotten bigger, which makes playing on just one controller much easier.
            <h2>Price and release date</h2>
            <p>Nintendo has announced that the Switch 2 will release sometime this year, but a specific date has not been mentioned. However, more information will be released by Nintendo the 2. of april. 
                The price is estimated to be between 399$-499$.</p>
