            <h2>AI-Generated Fake Sources Spark Scandal in Tromsø</h2>
            <p>Tromsø Municipality has found itself in a scandal after using artificial intelligence (AI) to generate sources in its proposal for a new kindergarten and school structure, which includes closing eight schools. Out of 18 listed sources, only seven could be verified. Among the fabricated references was a 2018 book titled "Quality in Schools: Learning, Well-being, and Relationships" by Professor Thomas Nordahl, which does not exist. Nordahl expressed surprise at being cited for something he never wrote.</p>
            <h2>Municipality Halts Proposal Amid Trust Concerns</h2>
            <p>Municipal Director Stig Tore Johnsen admitted that AI was used as a tool and has decided to halt the consultation process for six months to review the errors. He emphasized the importance of trust in decision-making and apologized for the serious mistakes. Researcher Jonas Stein described the incident as Norway's first major AI scandal in the public sector, highlighting the risks of relying on AI-generated data without proper quality control.</p>
