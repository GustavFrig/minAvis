                    NEW DELHI, March 20 (Reuters) - India's IT ministry has unlawfully expanded censorship powers to
                    allow
                    the easier removal of online content and empowered "countless" government officials to execute such
                    orders, Elon Musk's X has alleged in a new lawsuit against New Delhi.
                    The lawsuit and the allegations mark an escalation in an ongoing legal dispute between X and Prime
                    Minister Narendra Modi's government over how New Delhi orders content to be taken down. It also
                    comes as
                    Musk is getting closer to launching his other key ventures Starlink and Tesla in India.

                    In the new court filing dated March 5, X argues India's IT Ministry is asking other departments to
                    use a
                    government website launched by the Ministry of Home Affairs last year to issue content blocking
                    orders
                    and mandate social media companies to join the website too.
                    This mechanism, X says, does not contain the stringent Indian legal safeguards on content removal
                    that
                    required such orders to be issued in cases such as harm to sovereignty or public order, and came
                    with
                    strict oversight of top officials.

                    India's IT ministry redirected a Reuters' request for comment to the home affairs ministry, which
                    did
                    not respond.
                    The website creates "an impermissible parallel mechanism" that causes "unrestrained censorship of
                    information in India", X said, adding it is seeking to quash the directive.
                    X's court papers are not public and were reported for the first time by media on Thursday.
                    The case was briefly heard earlier this week by a judge in the High Court of southern Karnataka
                    state
                    but no final decision was reached. It will now be heard on March 27.
                    In 2021, X, formerly called Twitter, was locked in a stand-off with the Indian government over
                    non-compliance of legal orders to block certain tweets related to a farmers' protest against
                    government
                    policies.
